### Hi there 👋
I'm a software engineer based in Madrid, Spain . I love solving hard problems and deciding between different tradeoffs. When I am not coding, I enjoy weightlifting 🏋️‍♂️, cycling 🚴‍♂️ and traveling ✈️.

I recently co-created Horus, an end-to-end open source observability solution for small microservice applications.
